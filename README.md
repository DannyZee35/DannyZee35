# Hi, I'm Danial 👋  
**Senior Full-Stack Engineer**  
*Building scalable, full-stack AI-powered web applications.*  

---

I’m a Full-Stack Engineer with 4+ years of hands-on experience building modern web applications. I enjoy designing intuitive frontends with tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and pairing them with solid backend systems using Node.js, Express, or Flask.

I’m comfortable working with both SQL and NoSQL databases like PostgreSQL and MongoDB, and I’ve used Zustand and Redux Toolkit for managing complex state in production apps.

Recently, I’ve started adding simple AI features using OpenAI where it actually improves the user experience.

I care about building things that are practical, efficient, and easy to maintain.
