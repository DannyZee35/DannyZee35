# Hi there, I'm Danial ðŸ‘‹

"I build web apps that work as hard as I do â€” without crashing at 3 AM." âš¡

ðŸ’¡ With 3 years of full-stack development experience, I specialize in creating scalable, production-grade web applications using the MERN stack and Next.js. My freelance journey has given me the opportunity to work on a variety of projects, each one expanding my skills and deepening my understanding of different technologies.

What really drives me is constantly learning and experimenting. Iâ€™m always on the lookout for smarter solutions to improve my workflow and the apps I build.

1) ðŸ“š Always Learning: I stay up-to-date by continuously experimenting with the latest tech and best practices.

2) ðŸ›  Hands-on Project Leadership: From Figma designs to fully functional applications, Iâ€™ve been involved in leading and developing the entire flow.

3) ðŸ¤– Self-Taught Expertise: My journey of learning everything from online resources like Google and YouTube has made me adaptable and quick to find solutions.

ðŸŒŸ My future goal is to delve into AI integration. Iâ€™m excited about exploring how AI technologies can enhance user experiences and improve business processes, focusing on practical integration rather than model development.
